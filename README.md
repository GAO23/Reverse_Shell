# Reverse_Shell
A reverse shell that was based on my a project I did for my college cybersecuirty course.
It allows a central server to issue shell commands to multiple client machines.
This tool allows convienient remote access to multiple computers over the internet.

The tool supports packet encryption and uses DNS port 53 as default listening port. It includes an utility compoenent if you use to disguise it as zip unpacker trojan.
